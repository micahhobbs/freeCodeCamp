                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.x. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of javascript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
    
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

                <h4>Basics</h4>
                
                <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.</p>
    
                <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
                
                <code>var Fr端h = "foobar";</code>
                
                <p>But, the variable fr端h is not the same as Fr端h because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
               
                <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated semicolons (;).</p>
    
                <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, see the detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.) Iit is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
    
                <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.</p>

                    <h2>Control flow and error handling</h2>
                </header>

                <p>JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically control flow statements, that you can use to incorporate a great deal of interactivity in your application. This chapter provides an overview of these statements.</p>

                <h4>Block statement</h4>

                <p>The most basic statement is a block statement that is used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets:</p>
                <code>
{
    statement_1;
    statement_2;
    .
    .
    .
    statement_n;
}
                </code>
